	note: Name of WSN node (NodeID and each node has only temperature sensor in our consideration, in our initial experimentatal setup, so following data directly conforms to temperature value)).

05	0x00 - 0xFF 	GenericNameComponent_Value

	note: No. of nodes to be experimented is lesser than 255 nodes used, so the ID would be lesser than 255.

	}

	>>> Start of TLV-format for Content TLV
	
	note: MetaInfo is avoided. Within Metadata fields, 'content type' has been avoided because of homogenous sensory data. FreshnessPeriod shall be used in future by manipulation of control plane of the SDN controller. FinalBlockID is avoided since only non-fragmented data samples are used.

	noteA: sha256 produces 64 bytes of hash signatures which occupies signifacant portion of 100-octet payload in 15.4 wire format rendering it unusable. So, signing has been diasbled for research purposes. It has been indicated with usage of 0xFF (unassigned signing type). However, for future research purposes in data integrity and provenance, it can be enabled for single octet name and single octet content networking (refer noteB).

	noteB: In simple, single octet sensory data carrying WSN nodes. We can consider augmenting the 64-byte hashing string. With multiple sources of identical data traversing through the NDN network, we could identify any anamolies in data integration.
	
	In conclusion, 
		the resulting NDN-TLV formatting for a single octet named and single octet data content would be ...
	
			| Data   | Name   | N.value || Content | Signature | |
	  		060B     0703     0801 XX    1501 XX   1601   FF
	
			060D07030801XX1401XX1601FF

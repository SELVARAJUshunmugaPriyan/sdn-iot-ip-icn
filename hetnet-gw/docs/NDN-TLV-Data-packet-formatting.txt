	note: No. of nodes to be experimented is < 255 nodes used so the ID would be < 255

	>> Start of TLV-format for Content TLV
	
	note: MetaInfo is avoided. Content type is avoided bcoz homogenous sensory data. FreshnessPeriod should be used in future by SDN controller. FinalBlockID is avoided since only non-fragmented data samples are used.

	note: Since signing has been disabled in 15.4 network, following encoding shall be ignored (refer below noteA).

}
	noteA: sha256 produces 64 bytes of hash signatures which occupies signifacant portion of 100-octet payload in 15.4 wire format rendering it unusable. So, signing has been diasbled for research purposes. It has been indicated with usage of 0xFF (unassigned signing type). However, for research purposes in data integrity and provenance, it can be enabled in single octet name and single octet content networking (refer noteB).

	noteB: In simple, single octet sensory data carrying WSN nodes. We can consider augmenting the 64-byte hashing string. With multiple sources of identical data traversing through the NDN network, we could identify any anamolies in data integration.
	
	So, the resulting NDN-TLV formatting for a single octet named and single octet data content would be ...
	
	| Data   | Name N.value | Content | Signature | |
	  060D     0703 0801 XX   1401 XX   1601   FF
	
	060D07030801XX1401XX1601FF
